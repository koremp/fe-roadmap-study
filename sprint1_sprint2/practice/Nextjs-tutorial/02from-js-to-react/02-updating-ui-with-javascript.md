## Updating the UI with JavaScript and DOM Methods

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>

    <script type="text/javascript">
      // Select the div element with 'app' id
      const app = document.getElementById('app')

      // Create a new H1 element
      const header = document.createElement('h1')

      // Create a new text node for the H1 element
      const headerContent = document.createTextNode(
        'Develop. Preview. Ship. üöÄ'
      )

      // Append the text to the H1 element
      header.appendChild(headerContent)

      // Place the H1 element inside the div
      app.appendChild(header)
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## HTML vs the DOM

If you look at the DOM elements inside your browser developer tools, you will notice the DOM includes the `<h1>` element. The DOM of the page is different from the source code - or in other words, the original HTML file you created.


This is because the HTML represents the initial page content, whereas the DOM represents the updated page content which was changed by the JavaScript code you wrote.

Updating the DOM with plain JavaScript is very powerful but verbose. You‚Äôve written all this code to add an `<h1>` element with some text:

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<script type="text/javascript">
  const app = document.getElementById('app')
  const header = document.createElement('h1')
  const headerContent = document.createTextNode('Develop. Preview. Ship. üöÄ')
  header.appendChild(headerContent)
  app.appendChild(header)
</script>
```

As the size of an app or team grows, it can become increasingly challenging to build applications this way.

With this approach, developers spend a lot of time writing instructions to tell the computer `how` it should do things. But wouldn't it be nice to describe `what` you want to show and let the computer figure out `how` to update the DOM?

## Imperative vs Declarative Programming

The code above is a good example of `imperative programming`. You‚Äôre writing the steps for `how` the user interface should be updated. But when it comes to building user interfaces, a declarative approach is often preferred because it can speed up the development process. Instead of having to write DOM methods, it would be helpful if developers were able to declare what they want to show (in this case, an h1 tag with some text).

In other words, `imperative programming` is like giving a chef step-by-step instructions on how to make a pizza. `Declarative programming` is like ordering a pizza without being concerned about the steps it takes to make the pizza. üçï

A popular declarative library that helps developers build user interfaces is [React](https://beta.reactjs.org/).

## React: A declarative UI library

As a developer, you can tell React what you want to happen to the user interface, and React will figure out the steps of how to update the DOM on your behalf.
