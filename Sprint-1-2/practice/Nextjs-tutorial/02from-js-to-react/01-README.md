## Rendering UI Interface

To understand how React works, we first need a basic understanding of how browsers interpret your code to create interactive user interfaces (UI).

When a user visits a web page, the server returns an HTML file to the browser that may look like this:

The browser then reads the HTML and constructs the Document Object Model (DOM).

## What is the DOM?

The DOM is an object representation of the HTML elements. It acts as a bridge between your code and the user interface, and has a tree-like structure with parent and child relationships.

You can use DOM methods and a programming language, such as JavaScript, to listen to user events and [manipulate the DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents) by selecting, adding, updating, and deleting specific elements in the user interface. DOM manipulation allows you to not only target specific elements, but also change their style and content.
